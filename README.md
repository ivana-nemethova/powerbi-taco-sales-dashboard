## 💬 Challenges & Learnings

While working on this project, I encountered several challenges that taught me a lot:

- Sales values were stored as text – I learned how to convert them to numbers
- Date and time were in a single field – I learned how to split them
- Weekdays were not sorted correctly – I created a numerical ordering
- Power BI was shortening numbers (e.g., 4.8K) – I learned how to adjust formatting

I learned that in data analytics, success is not just about visualization, but also about **thorough data preparation, attention to detail, and continuously learning new techniques**.

## ✅ Conclusion

This is **my very first Power BI project**. I created this dashboard to practice working with real-world data using Power Query, DAX, and data visualization techniques.  

This project represents my first step into the field of data analytics, and **every day I worked on it, I learned something new** – whether technical or analytical.

If you're viewing this project as a potential employer, I’d appreciate your feedback — and even more so the opportunity to continue growing professionally.
